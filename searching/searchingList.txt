Here is a comprehensive list of searching algorithms with their main techniques and sub-techniques for practice:

### 1. Basic Searching Algorithms
- **Linear Search**
  - Simple scan
  - Sentinel Linear Search
- **Binary Search**
  - Classic binary search on sorted arrays
  - Finding first/last occurrence
  - Lower bound / Upper bound
  - Binary search on answer (search in a custom range)
  - Search in rotated sorted array
  - Search in 2D matrix
  - Search with duplicates

***

### 2. Two-Pointer Techniques
- Classic two-pointer for pairs or triplets
- **Duplicate Skipping** (to avoid repeating results)
- Sliding Window (variable size window)
  - Fixed-size sliding window
  - Dynamic sliding window
  - Maximum/minimum sum subarray
  - Longest substring with k-distinct chars
- Meeting point / cycle detection (Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare)

***

### 3. Hashing Based Search
- HashSet based membership checks
- HashMap frequency counts
- Two Sum pattern
- Pattern searching with hash
- Problems involving prefix sums/hashes

***

### 4. Tree and Graph Search
- Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Recursive DFS
  - Iterative DFS (using stack)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Level order traversal
  - Bidirectional BFS
- Dijkstra’s algorithm (shortest path variant)
- A* search algorithm

***

### 5. String Searching Algorithms
- Naive pattern matching
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
- Rabin-Karp
- Z Algorithm
- Aho-Corasick (multi-pattern matching)
- Suffix array/tree based search

***

### 6. Advanced Numerical and Search Techniques
- Exponential Search
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Ternary Search (for unimodal functions)
- Fibonacci Search

***

### 7. Special Data Structure Based Search
- Trie (Prefix tree) search
- Binary Search Trees (BST) search
- Heaps (priority queue search)
- Searching with Backtracking (permutations, subsets)

***

### 8. Search with Pattern Recognition
- Backtracking searches (puzzle solving, N-Queens)
- Bitmasking search enhancements
- Branch and Bound techniques

***

This list broadly covers fundamental and advanced searching algorithms with note on important sub-techniques such as **duplicate skipping in two pointer** methods. Practicing across these will strengthen problem-solving across domains.
