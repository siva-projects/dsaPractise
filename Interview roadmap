What we need to learn

- React.js ( react router )
- revise topics on Node js
- revise DB related topics
- DSA ( LOOK in vs code dsa workspace, every folder has a .txt inside it which can be used)
- system design
- Next.js ( By the time I start learning this, I should be able to learn all related topics )

- Have been using roadmap.sh to keep track of things.




************************************************************************************************************

1️⃣ Which role should you target?

Target Role:
👉 SDE-1 (Software Development Engineer – Level 1)
👉 At product companies / MAANG-level companies

Why this is correct for you:

Current role: System Analyst (enterprise setup)
Current CTC: ₹8 LPA
Product companies evaluate by engineering depth, not title
SDE-1 is the right entry point into product engineering

************************************************************************************************************

2️⃣ What pay can you expect for that role?
🇮🇳 India (MAANG / Tier-1 Product Companies)
Role	Typical CTC Range
SDE-1	₹18 – 30 LPA
Lower band	₹15 – 18 LPA
Upper band (strong candidate)	₹25 – 30 LPA
This is 2–3× your current salary, even at the lower end.

************************************************************************************************************


3️⃣ What technical areas must you be confident in?
✅ MUST-HAVE (Non-Negotiable)
🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (70–80% weight)

You should be confident in:
Arrays, Strings
Hashing
Stack, Queue
Linked List
Trees, BST
Recursion
Dynamic Programming
Basic Graphs (BFS/DFS)

👉 Ability expected:
Solve LeetCode Medium consistently
Write clean, bug-free code
Explain time & space complexity

************************************************************************************************************

✅ GOOD-TO-HAVE (Light expectation)
🔹 Basic System Knowledge (NOT heavy design)
You should be able to explain:
How a REST API works
Basic HTTP methods
Simple DB schema design
Difference between SQL vs NoSQL (high level)
Authentication basics (JWT / session — conceptual)
⚠️ No deep system design expected for SDE-1.


❌ NOT REQUIRED (for SDE-1)
Distributed system design
Load balancing, sharding
Kafka, Redis internals
High-level architecture diagrams
These are SDE-2+ topics.

************************************************************************************************************

4️⃣ How interviewers will evaluate you

They’ll check:

Can you solve problems independently?
Can you optimize brute force solutions?
Can you communicate your approach clearly?
Are you trainable for large systems?

They will not judge you on:
Your current title
Enterprise vs product background
